Performance Optimizations
1. Image Optimization

Add lazy loading for images in portfolio and service sections
Implement WebP format with fallbacks
Use responsive images with different sizes for mobile/desktop
Consider adding image compression
2. Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization

Implement React.lazy() for page components to enable code splitting
Use dynamic imports for heavy components that aren't immediately visible
Move large animations and effects to separate chunks
3. Animation Performance

Reduce the number of simultaneous animations on page load
Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties
Add will-change property for animated elements
Consider using transform3d() to trigger hardware acceleration
4. Loading States

Add skeleton loaders for content that takes time to load
Implement progressive loading for complex animations
Add loading indicators for page transitions
UI/UX Improvements
1. Visual Hierarchy

Reduce the number of neon colors used simultaneously (currently using 5+ neon colors)
Create better contrast ratios for accessibility
Simplify the gradient combinations - some sections have too many overlapping gradients
2. Animation Refinement

Reduce animation duration for faster perceived performance
Add prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility
Limit floating animations to 2-3 elements per section instead of current 4+
3. Content Organization

Break down large sections into smaller, digestible chunks
Add more white space between sections
Implement a cleaner card design with less visual noise
4. Mobile Experience

Optimize touch targets (minimum 44px)
Reduce animation complexity on mobile devices
Improve text readability on smaller screens
5. Interactive Elements

Add hover states that provide clear feedback
Implement focus states for keyboard navigation
Add micro-interactions for form elements
Technical Suggestions
1. CSS Optimization

Remove unused CSS custom properties
Consolidate similar animation keyframes
Use CSS containment for isolated components
2. Component Structure

Extract repeated animation patterns into reusable components
Create a centralized animation configuration
Implement a design token system for consistent spacing and colors
3. Accessibility

Add proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
Implement keyboard navigation
Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
4. Performance Monitoring

Add performance metrics tracking
Implement error boundaries for better error handling
Consider adding a service worker for caching
